# Micro Scalper Forex Robot

## Description
This code represents a Forex robot called Micro Scalper. It is designed to identify trading opportunities based on price action and tick data volatility within a specific range. The robot calculates the volatility and checks if it falls within the desired range. If a suitable opportunity is identified, a buy order is placed with a specified lot size, stop loss, and slippage.

The robot also includes functions to monitor the trade, modify the take profit level, and implement risk management strategies. The lot size is calculated based on a risk percentage per trade and a predefined stop loss value. The unique identifier (magic number) is used to differentiate the robot's orders from other systems or manual trades.
